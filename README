Goliath Base App
----------------

We love Rails, we love Sinatra even more and we love Goliath just a teensy bit more.

More on Goliath:

Event Programming:

I liked the idea of using Goliath to serve up smaller apps that are generally just a few thousand lines of code or less.

In a couple of hours I hacked together this base app that we at W3matter could continually improve and use in small high-performing setting.

So goliath_base_app was born.

USEAGE:
-------

1. Clone the repo and bundle 'er up!

# git clone 
# bundle install

2. Startup the server

# ruby main.rb -sv -p 3000

3. Hack away.

CONTROLLERS:

# app/controllers/me_controller.rb

Class MeController < ApplicationController
	def index
	end

	def some_action
		@id = params[:id]
	end
end

In your browser:
/me
/me/some_action/99


MVC CONVENTIONS:
----------------

Directories
Basically, the same as rails.
----
app
app/views
app/controllers
app/models

Routing
----
Routes are stored in main.rb
You'll see the default route in there. Don't remove it unless you need to be more restful or explicit.
You can add more routes ahead of that one.

Database
----
This is Goliath, and EventMachine under the hood. So use the appropriate database drivers.


PERFORMANCE:
------------

Going through *this* full stack in production mode is consistently under 2ms. That's right. Under 2 milliseconds.


CAVEATS:
--------

1. I'm not the best ruby programmer in the world. So if you have suggestions, let me know. Do a pull request. Keep things constructive.

2. There are no tests are yet

3. There are surely bugs lurking around.

4. This is not intended to be a replacement for Rails or even Sinatra
It's a solution for small, extremely lightweight apps that inherits the benefits of event programming without spaghetti. Exactly what Goliath brings to the table.
